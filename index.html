          <p>When I first started interning for big companies, I tried to do things my own way without realizing they were unprofessional. For example, I revised templates when I was only supposed to fill in the blank, I overpromised, and I didn’t see the big picture of the work I was doing. Whether you are looking for an internship in accounting or marketing, the life of an intern can be challenging. You only have a short period of time to adapt to a new environment; meanwhile, it’s important to leave a lasting impression on others as a professional. Here are some lessons I have learned from my previous internships.
          </p>
 
 
    <h5>Don’t Overpromise</h5>
    <p>When you are assigned a project, don’t say that you will finish the project by a certain time. Instead, you can say that you would like to follow up on your progress by a specific time. This way, if you finish by then, you will be an overachiever. On the other hand, if you have not finished it yet, it’s also acceptable, because it’s within the expectations of others—and you keep them posted on where you are on the assigned project.
    </p>

   <h5>Connect the Dots</h5>
    <p>For every task you are assigned, it’s usually not a stand-alone project. You should try to understand the big picture behind it. For example, you should try to understand the reason why this work needs to be done and how this work will affect other departments or even the entire company. You might also want to ask yourself, “Is it something that has to be done before a certain time? What is the risk if you make one mistake, and how will it affect the flow of other people’s work?”</p>

<h5>Restate the Task</h5>
<p>When someone gives you an assignment, you should take down some notes. Then, restate what you think you should do to the person who assigned you the task and ask them if you understand it correctly. This will help you avoid unnecessary confusion and miscommunication.</p>

     
<h5>Follow the Instructions</h5>
<p>When your supervisor asks you to do some task in a specific way, it’s essential to follow the instructions not only because they are depending on you to finish it in the way they wanted but also because it might be time-sensitive. Your job as an intern is to make their work easier, so follow the rules and instructions. If you have an alternative way of solving the problem, you should propose it to your supervisor when they have time.</p>


<h5>Mimic Your Colleagues</h5>
<p>When you enter a new working environment, it’s better to follow what other colleagues do than to do things your own way. For example, if they all leave at 6 pm, you should also leave at 6 pm. If they all leave at 9 pm, you’d better not be the first one to leave the office. That is, try to observe how other colleagues interact with each other and try to get a sense of the office culture. By doing so, you can quickly fit into the team rather than being an outlier.</p>



<p>Though internships can be intimidating for students, these lessons have helped me to be more professional at work and have developed me to be better at what I do. Now that you are equipped with these invaluable lessons, go ahead, and do your best in your internship. Hopefully, the five lessons I’ve shared today can be of some help to you.</p>
